- **Relationship Density**: {{relationship_density}}
- **Graph Connectivity**: {{graph_connectivity_target}}

## Known Entities
{% for entity in entities %}
- **{{entity.text}}** ({{entity.type}}) at position {{entity.start_pos}}-{{entity.end_pos}}
{% endfor %}

## Relationship Patterns
Focus on these relationship types based on domain analysis:
{% for rel_type, pattern in relationship_patterns.items() %}
- **{{rel_type}}**: {{pattern.description}} (confidence: {{pattern.confidence}})
  - Typical indicators: {{pattern.indicators|join(', ')}}
  - Context requirements: {{pattern.context_requirements}}
{% endfor %}

## Text Content
```
{{content}}
```

## Extraction Requirements

3. Include relationship strength/confidence scoring
4. Capture contextual evidence for each relationship
5. Map to domain-specific relationship taxonomy
6. Validate relationship consistency and logical coherence

## Expected Output Format
For each relationship, provide:
- **source_entity**: Source entity text and type
- **target_entity**: Target entity text and type  
- **relationship_type**: Classified relationship type
- **direction**: Relationship directionality
- **confidence**: Relationship confidence (0.0-1.0)
- **evidence**: Text evidence supporting the relationship
- **context**: Surrounding context
- **properties**: Additional relationship attributes
- **validation**: Consistency check results
